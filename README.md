[![GitHub tag (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/christippett/terraform-google-cloud-sql-pgbouncer?label=Version)](./CHANGELOG.md) [![Terraform Registry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terraform-Registry-623CE4)](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/christippett/cloud-sql-pgbouncer/)

Let Cloud Run wild on your database 🐆

## Overview

This module creates a Compute Engine instance running PgBouncer that sits in front of a Cloud SQL or self-hosted PostgreSQL instance.

Refer to the [examples/](./examples/) sub-directory for a complete example of how this module can be integrated and used with Cloud SQL.

```hcl
module "pgbouncer" {
  source  = "christippett/cloud-sql-pgbouncer/google"
  version = "~>1.2"

  project      = var.project
  name         = "pgbouncer"
  zone         = "us-central1-a"
  subnetwork   = "subnet-1"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"

  port          = 25128
  database_host = 5432

  users = [
    { name = "admin", password = "password", admin = true },
    { name = "user", password = "user_password" }
  ]
}
```

## Authentication

The `users` map accepts an optional `admin` key. When this is set to `true`, the user will be added to the list of PgBouncer admins and stats users.

## Configuring PgBouncer

Only a subset of PgBouncer's configuration are exposed as input variables. If you wish to customise PgBouncer further, you're able to provide your own configuration via the `pgbouncer_custom_config` input variable (type `map(string)`). The values from this variable will be added to `pgbouncer.ini`.

The `pgbouncer.ini` template used by this module can be found [here](./modules/pgbouncer_cloud_init/templates/pgbouncer.ini.tmpl). Refer to the [official PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html) for a full list of configuration options.
